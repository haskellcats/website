  <h2>The Life Page</h2>

  <p>
In March 2016 the Haskellcats were sent to investigate the weird world of
Smooth Life (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1567">https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1567</a>).
This was one of their first missions ever.
  </p>

  <p>Imagine regular Conway's Life with these modifications:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Infinite grid replaced with the two dimensional real plane</li>
    <li>Life/death of cells replaced with a continuous value between 0 and 1</li>
    <li>Neighbor counting replaced with an integral of each point's circular neighborhood</li>
    <li>Discrete time steps replaced with continuous time</li>
    <li>Discrete transition rules replaced with a differential equation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
If that sounds wacky, that is what the Haskellcats are all about. Here is
a youtube video of a form of smooth life.

  </p>

  <p>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/smoothlife/">There is one smooth life
implementation in C++</a> which makes use of GPU magic to get reasonable
performance. Clearly there needed to be some sort of an attempt at this
in Haskell.
  </p>

  <p>
Well, I didn't get to the smooth part. But here are two simple implementations
of regular life complete with graphics:
<a href="https://github.com/haskellcats/life-experiment">github repo</a>.
One implementation uses Gloss's pure interface and the
<a href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/12/evaluating-cellular-automata-is.html">
stupid comonad trick</a>. The other one uses a mutable multidimensional array
in an attempt to get better performance, and to demonstrate that Haskell has
mutable multidimensional arrays.
  </p>

  <p>Video of that program in action, though I can see it wasn't finalized
when I made the video.</p>

  <p>Around that time I also threw together some 3D life to demonstrate OpenGL in Haskell:</p>

  <p>Weird 3D oscillators!</p>

  <h3>Let's Get Infinite</h3>

  <p>All of the Lifes listed so far have been on a periodic playing field. So
whenever information was needed past the edge of the area, the sampler would
look at the exact opposite side. This causes the world to behave as if it
were infinitely tiled in every direction, or to be wrapped onto the surface
of a donut.</p>

  <p>More sophisticated implementations will allow an infinite playing field
by dynamically allocating more space as the patterns grew toward the edge.
Very sophisticated ones will recognize individual spaceships and simulate
them specially to get more memory performance. But all of them require your
initial starting pattern to be bounded, finite. Makes sense. Either the
starting pattern is finite or its an infinite repeating pattern.</p>

  <p>But wait! It is theoretically possible to begin with an <b>arbitrary
infinite pattern!</b></p>

  <p>How? Well you can represent an infinite pattern on the grid using a
function from <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Z² → Bool</span>.
This will let you encode any computable starting
pattern. Cool, but how would you expect to compute even the second generation?</p>

  <p>Instead of trying to explain, I will show the code. The life program
will be a function that takes the starting pattern (a function of grid coords),
a position to check, and a step number. It will return a Bool for the state
of the cell.</p>

  <code>life :: (Z² → Bool) → Z² → N → Bool
life start p step = go p step <b>where</b>
  go p 0 = start p
  go p step = (rule current . sum . map check . neighbs) p <b>where</b>
    current = go p (step - 1)
    check p = <b>if</b> go p (step - 1) <b>then</b> 1 <b>else</b> 0
    neighbs p = [p + P dx dy | dx ← [-1..1], dy ← [-1..1], (dx,dy) /= (0,0)]
    rule False 3 = True
    rule False _ = False
    rule True n | n &lt; 2     = False
                | n &gt; 3     = False
                | otherwise = True</code>

  <p>If you ask for the status of a cell at step 0 then it will use the
  starting pattern. If you ask for step 1 then it will recursively check its
  own status and the status of neighbors at step <span style="white-space: nowrap">1-1=0</span>.  
  This again uses the starting pattern. Already we can see this algorithm has a
  good chance of terminating for any step number we want.</p>

  <p>Of course the amount of work to get to each subsequent step will increase
  greatly. Like an expanding wave front, the area the algorithm needs to
  inspect for each visible cell will grow at the speed of light.</p>
