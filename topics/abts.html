  <h2>Practical Foundations for Programming Languages: Abstract Binding Trees</h2>

  <p>Jan 28, 2017</p>

  <p>
Yes! We have an actual topic for Monday. From the perspective of a compiler, you
would like to think of code not as text but as structured "abstract syntax". This
form of the code ignores the limitations of ASCII rendering and focuses only on the
grammatical structure. The concrete form of the ASCII source can be considered
an <i>image</i> of the abstract syntax. Conversely, parsers have the non-trivial job
of reconstructing abstract syntax from concrete syntax.
  </p>

  <p>
In Bob Harper's textbook Practical Foundations for Programming Languages he
begins with a general theory of abstract syntax enriched with the notion of
"binding forms". Examples of binding forms:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>let x = 2 in x + x</li>
    <li>Œªx . x (y x)</li>
    <li>forall a . [a] ‚Üí [a]</li>
    <li>[1,2,3].each{|x| puts (x+1)}</li>
    <li>Œ†<sub>x:A</sub> B(x)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
Basically they introduce variables which can be referenced within a specific
scope. There are many features that make use of binding, but the machinery to
manage references and scopes is the same for them all.
  </p>

  <p>
How does that machinery work? I don't know, but we have some reading material.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Section 1.1 and 1.2 of Harper's book</li>
    <li><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1df1/a0b5e9d14855e24deb7cd602bdef9445a435.pdf">McBride's Functional Pearl: I am not a Number‚ÄîI am a Free Variable</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://semantic-domain.blogspot.com/2015/03/abstract-binding-trees.html">Blog post by Neelakantan Krishnaswami</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://winterkoninkje.dreamwidth.org/103978.html">Blog post by Wren Romano</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
<b>Challenge:</b> In whatever language, implement some kind of abstract binding
tree structure which supports:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>multiple kinds of binders</li>
    <li>abstraction (convert free variables to bound variables)</li>
    <li>substitution</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Epilogue</h3>

  <p>Jan 30, 2017</p>

  <p>Substitution gone wrong in the presence of binding:</p>

  <code>LC&gt; (Œªx Œªy . x y)(Œªz . y) -- last y is free
Œªy . (Œªz . y) y           -- inner y erroneously bound
</code>

  <p>Using de Bruijn indices instead of names for bound variables fixes it:</p>

  <code>LC&gt; (Œª_ Œª_ . 1 0)(Œª_ . y) -- y is free therefore named
Œª_ . (Œª_ . y) 0           -- correct. y is still free
</code>

  <p>You can also rename all bound variables against whats free in the replacement:</p>

  <code>LC&gt; (Œªx Œªy . x y)(Œªz . y) -- last y is free
Œªy' . (Œªz . y) y'         -- inner y still free
</code>

  <p>And this is how capture-avoiding substitution works in the blog post and
in Harper.</p>

  <p>The functional pearl prefers to use indexes for bound variables and names
for free variables.</p>

  <code>data Expr =
  F Name            | -- free named variable
  B Int             | -- bound numbered variable
  App Expr Expr     | -- apply
  Forall Expr Scope   -- forall _ in Expr . Expr(_)

newtype Scope = Sc Expr -- contains exactly one "dangling" bound variable
</code>

All operations on expressions are built up from two basic
operations: abstraction and instantiation. Substitution of free variables with
expressions is literally the composition of the two.</p>

  <code>&gt; ex0 -- an expression with no binders in it, no indexes
(sqrt ((+ (sqr x)) (sqr y))) :: Expr

&gt; abstract "x" ex0 -- punch out a hole at x
(sqrt ((+ (sqr 0)) (sqr y))) :: Scope

&gt; instantiate (F "z") (abstract "x" ex0) -- fill in hole with some expression
(sqrt ((+ (sqr z)) (sqr y))) :: Expr

substitute name subject = instantiate subject . abstract name
</code>

  <p>From here we can play with the example language's one binding form.
Namely <span style="white-space: nowrap">"forall _ in Expr . Expr(_)"</span>.</p>

  <code>&gt; ex1 -- quantified expression has anonymous variable
(‚àÄ _ œµ N . (= 0 0)) :: Expr
</code>

  <p>Define an operation to deconstruct a quantified expression by naming the variable.</p>

  <code>&gt; let name &lt;--- Forall dom body = ((name, dom), instantiate (F name) body)
&gt; "x" &lt;--- ex1
(("x",N),(= x x)) -- dom and body now available for further analysis
</code>

  <p>And an inverse operation to abstract over a pre-existing free variable.</p>

  <code>&gt; let (name, dom) ---&gt; body = Forall dom (abstract name body)

&gt; ("x",F "N") ---&gt; App (App (F "=") (F "x")) (F "x")
(‚àÄ _ œµ N . (= 0 0)) -- everything neatly packed up again

&gt; ("=",F "N") ---&gt; App (App (F "=") (F "x")) (F "x")
(‚àÄ _ œµ N . (0 x x)) -- careful where you point that!

&gt; ("N",(F "Type")) ---&gt; ex1
(‚àÄ _ œµ Type . (‚àÄ _ in 1 . (= 0 0))) -- üëç
</code>

  <p>In this way an expression can be processed from top to bottom by providing
names in order to go inside of binders. A scheme to choose these names in a
meaningful and efficient way is described in McBride's paper.</p>

  <p>Conversely an Expr may be constructed from some other source in order to
separate the names from the pure structure. This will allow comparison of
code up to alpha equivalence and safe substitutions.</p>

  <p>Algorithms to process expressions then amount to zipping and unzipping
back and forth to consume or provide bound names. In the second half of
the paper this sort of traversal is abstracted out into its own higher order
function.</p>

  <p>Finally they show how they used this in Epigram to generate code for
induction principles from user-defined data types.</p>

<!--
  <p>We covered a lot of ground tonight. Let me see if I can organize what
we did and why. What we did:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Attempted to decipher the OCaml code from semantic domain, which
presumably defines a generic way to handle ABTs for any language. We still
don't know what the constructor `Tm' is supposed to stand for in Neelakantan's
code.</li>
    <li>Explained what ABTs were in the first place, but didn't really explain
why anyone would care.
<a href="https://github.com/haskellcats/ast-abt-experiment">
See the Idris code which encodes the AST and ABT as defined in PFPL.</a>
    </li>
    <li>Demonstrated cool things you can do with the technique described in
McBride's functional pearl. Specifically: substituting expressions for a
free variable, wrapping an expression with a binder which binds
and anonymizes one of the free variables, consuming expressions with binders
by choosing names for variables, comparing expressions for equality up to
alpha equivalence, and (de)serializing expressions with binders.
<a href="https://github.com/haskellcats/ast-abt-experiment">
Haskell code for that is available.</a> But we didn't get to the automatic
name generation algorithm.
    </li>
    <li>Tried to figure out what to do with this.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So this technique specifically helps with algorithms that manage code for
  languages with binders. In the case of Epigram, the task was to generate
  induction principles for datatypes defined by the programmer. This involves
  generating code and to display code you have to choose names for variables.
  The second half of the paper describes a sane way to do this. Future food for
  thought!</p>
