  <h2>Practical Foundations for Programming Languages: Abstract Binding Trees</h2>

  <p>Jan 28, 2017</p>

  <p>
Yes! We have an actual topic for Monday. From the perspective of a compiler you
would like to think of code not as text but as structured "abstract syntax". This
form of the code ignores the limitations of ASCII rendering and focuses only on the
grammatical structure. The concrete form of the ASCII source can be considered
an <i>image</i> of the abstract syntax. Conversely, parsers have the non-trivial job
of reconstructing abstract syntax from concrete syntax.
  </p>

  <p>
In Bob Harper's textbook Practical Foundations for Programming Languages he
begins with a general theory of abstract syntax enriched with the notion of
"binding forms". Examples of binding forms:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>let x = 2 in x + x</li>
    <li>λx . x (y x)</li>
    <li>forall a . [a] → [a]</li>
    <li>[1,2,3].each{|x| puts (x+1)}</li>
    <li>Π<sub>x:A</sub> B(x)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
Basically they introduce variables which can be referenced within a specific
scope. There are many features that make use of binding, but the machinery to
manage references and scopes is the same for them all.
  </p>

  <p>
How does that machinery work? I don't know, but we have some references.

    <li><a href="https://winterkoninkje.dreamwidth.org/103978.html">Blog post by Wren Romano</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
<b>Challenge:</b> In whatever language, implement some kind of abstract binding
tree structure which supports:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>multiple kinds of binders</li>
    <li>abstraction (convert free variables to bound variables)</li>
    <li>substitution</li>
  </ul>
